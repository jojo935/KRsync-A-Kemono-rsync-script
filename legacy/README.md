# Usah-s-Kemono-rsync-scripts
Some scripts I made that will allow people with minimum knowledge in using rsync and Bash to utilize kemono.party's rsync service.


# Instructions
You must edit the output directory listed in the files to the directory which you would like to use. This can be easily done in any text editor.

# How to use
* 1: Edit the output directory in the text editor of your choosing
* 2: Place scripts wherever you find most useful
* 3: Open Terminal and cd into that folder
* 4: Run the script like so: ~$ ./script.sh ( ./Patreon.sh for example)
* 5: Input the ID of the user/discord and press enter
* 6: ???
* 7: Profit
